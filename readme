Assignment 4

Nick: I debugged Saadis JQuery and Axaj code and
helped patch some bugs that his code had. Also,
I styled the code to get a higher grade from
pylint.

Saadi: I changed the style of the html code to a
responsive layout with a princeton color theme. I
also implemented the jquery/ajax code in the html
template and the flask /searchresults code. I did
some quick bug fixes and basic testing.
